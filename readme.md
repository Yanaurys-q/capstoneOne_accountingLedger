# Accounting Ledger
#### This application is a simple console-based accounting ledger that allows users to add deposits, make payments, and view or filter their transaction history. The main menu offers options to add a deposit, make a payment (debit), view the ledger, or exit. Transactions are saved to a CSV file, and users can view all transactions, only deposits, only payments, or generate reports of your transaction history.

One interesting piece of code in this project is the custom search feature that allows users to filter transactions using any combination. Each filter is applied only if the user provides a value, making the search flexible and user-friendly. This was a pain to get to work properly and took longer than I would like to admit it really elevated the application and was a big learning moment.
